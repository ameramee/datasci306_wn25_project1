## Overview

In the `data` directory of this project you will find the file from a paper published in *Nature Energy* titled [Natural gas savings in Germany during the 2022 energy crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01260-5). Here is the abstract of the article:

> Russia curbed its natural gas supply to Europe in 2021 and 2022, creating a grave energy crisis. This Article empirically estimates the crisis response of natural gas consumers in Germany—for decades, the largest export market for Russian gas. Using a multiple regression model, we estimate the response of small consumers, industry and power stations separately, controlling for the nonlinear temperature-heating relationship, seasonality and trends. We find significant and substantial gas savings for all consumer groups, but with differences in timing and size. For instance, industry started reducing consumption as early as September 2021, while small consumers saved substantially only since March 2022. Across all sectors, gas consumption during the second half of 2022 was 23% below the temperature-adjusted baseline. We discuss the drivers behind these savings and draw conclusions on their role in coping with the crisis.

Your job in this project falls into two categories:

1. A set of **tasks** that your group must complete exactly
2. A set of **objectives** that are more general in their approach.

## Tasks

### Task 1

* Load two files. To work in the console, use the `Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location`.
    * Call the first table `daily`: "./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv"
    * Call the second table `gas`: "./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv". Be sure to properly import the `Date` column.
    * Demonstrate that these have been loaded by showing the number of rows and columns in each table.
```{r}
daily <- read_csv("./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv")
gas <- read_csv(
  "./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"),  
    Price = col_double(),
    Open = col_double(),
    High = col_double(),
    Low = col_double(),
    `Vol.` = col_character(),
    `Change %` = col_character())
  )
```

### Task 2

* The data in `daily` are collected over days, with information on different types of natural gas consumption (`consumption_small`, `consumption_industry`, `consumption_power`). Provide summaries of typical values for each of these three types of consumption.

```{r}
summary_small <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
)

summary_industry <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
)

summary_power <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)
)

print(summary_small)
print(summary_industry)
print(summary_power)

```


### Task 3

Answer some questions about the data in `daily`:

* How many weeks do the data cover?
The data covers 312.86 weeks (Ask about rounding!!)
```{r}
weeks <- daily |> summarize(num_weeks = as.numeric(difftime(max(date), min(date), units = "weeks")))
print(weeks)
```
* What is the percentage change in the `consumption_*` variables (that is the last day minus the first day divided by the first day)?
consumption_small % change: -99.01%
consumption_industry % change: -43.28%
consumption_power % change: -49.44
```{r}
percentage_change <- daily |> filter(!is.na(consumption_small))|> summarize(
    change_small = last(consumption_small) - first(consumption_small) / first(consumption_small) * 100,
    change_industry = (last(consumption_industry) - first(consumption_industry)) / first(consumption_industry) * 100,
    change_power = (last(consumption_power) - first(consumption_power)) / first(consumption_power) * 100
  )
print(percentage_change)
```
* What proportion of the days are marked as holidays?
0.0361
```{r}
proportion <- daily |> summarize(holiday_days = sum(holiday, na.rm = TRUE), total_days = n(), proportion =
                                                    holiday_days / total_days)
print(holidays)
```
* For each month in each year, what was the year-month combination with the lowest median `consumption_power` value?
August 2021 has the lowest median_power with 0.1635
```{r}
lowest_median <- daily |>
  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date)) |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  summarize(median_power = median(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(median_power)
print(lowest_median)
```
   
### Task 4

* The original paper aggregated the data to monthly means for each consumption type in `daily` and the `Price` column of `gas` to produce the following image:<br/>
![Original consumption by month graph](proj1fig1.png)<br/>
Produce plots that show the same information that is presented in this plot. Your plots do not have to have the same colors or markings, but we should be able to use them to compare the trends for the three price variables.

```{r}
# Aggregate daily data (indices) to monthly means
daily_monthly <- daily %>%
  mutate(year_month = format(date, "%Y-%m")) %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarize(
    price_households_idx = mean(price_households_idx, na.rm = TRUE),
    price_industry_idx = mean(price_industry_idx, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  mutate(year_month = as.Date(paste0(year_month, "-01")))

# Aggregate gas data (TTF price) to monthly means
gas_monthly <- gas %>%
  mutate(year_month = format(Date, "%Y-%m")) %>%
  group_by(year_month) %>%
  summarize(price_mean = mean(Price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  mutate(year_month = as.Date(paste0(year_month, "-01")))

# Plot
p <- ggplot() +
  # Left y-axis: TTF Price
  geom_line(
    data = gas_monthly,
    aes(x = year_month, y = price_mean, color = "Natural gas price TTF"),
    size = 1
  ) +
  # Right y-axis: Household Price Index (solid)
  geom_line(
    data = daily_monthly,
    aes(x = year_month, y = price_households_idx, color = "Natural gas price index for households DE"),
    size = 1
  ) +
  # Right y-axis: Industry Price Index (dashed)
  geom_line(
    data = daily_monthly,
    aes(x = year_month, y = price_industry_idx, color = "Natural gas price index for industry DE"),
    linetype = "dashed",
    size = 1
  ) +
  # Vertical lines at Jan 2020, Jan 2021, Jan 2022, Jan 2023
  geom_vline(
    xintercept = as.Date(c("2020-01-01", "2021-01-01", "2022-01-01", "2023-01-01")),
    linetype = "solid",
    color = "black",
    size = 0.7
  ) +
  # X-axis from Apr 2019 to Feb 2023 (adjust as needed)
  scale_x_date(
    date_breaks = "3 months",
    date_labels = "%b\n%Y",
    limits = c(as.Date("2019-04-01"), as.Date("2023-02-28"))
  ) +
  # Separate y-axes
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Natural gas price TTF (€/MWh)",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ ., name = "Natural gas price indices (2015 = 100)")
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Monthly Mean Natural Gas Prices and Price Indices in Germany",
    x = "Date",
    color = "Legend"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "top")

print(p)
```

### Task 5

* Write a predicate function that returns true if any value in vector is missing. Use this function to find columns with missing values in the `daily` column. Create a plot or table that shows how often patterns of missingness occur: are all of the missing values in the same rows or are the various columns missing data in different ways?

```{r}
  has_missing <- function(x) {
  any(is.na(x))
}

missing_columns <- sapply(daily, has_missing)
print("Columns with missing values:")
print(missing_columns[missing_columns == TRUE])

daily_missing_pattern <- daily |>
  mutate(missing_pattern = apply(is.na(daily), 1, function(row) {
    paste(ifelse(row, "1", "0"), collapse = "")
  })) |>
  count(missing_pattern) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))

  
print(daily_missing_pattern)

ggplot(daily_missing_pattern, aes(x = missing_pattern, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Missingness Patterns in Daily Data",
       x = "Missingness Pattern (1 = Missing, 0 = Present)",
       y = "Count of Rows") +
  theme_minimal()

```

The missingness pattern plot shows that most rows have no missing values, but there are multiple distinct patterns where different columns are missing data. This indicates that missing values are not concentrated in a single set of rows, but instead, different columns have missing values in varying ways. Some rows have only one or two missing values, while others have a unique combination of missing columns. This suggests that missingness is likely due to incomplete data collection or specific external factors affecting different variables separately rather than a single systematic issue affecting entire rows.



### Task 6

* Limit the `gas` table to days where the price exceeded the yearly median. Use the concept of [circular means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_mean) to compute the average day of the year when price exceeds the yearly median price. The `yday` function will likely be useful here. 

```{r circular-mean, echo=TRUE}

gas_circ <- gas |>
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) |> group_by(Year) |> mutate(yearly_median = median(Price, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  filter(Price > yearly_median) |>
  mutate(
    day_of_year = yday(Date),
    n_days = if_else(leap_year(Date), 366, 365)
  ) |>
  summarise(
    circ_mean_day = {
      angles <- 2 * pi * (day_of_year / n_days)
      
      avg_cos <- mean(cos(angles))
      avg_sin <- mean(sin(angles))
      
      mean_angle <- atan2(avg_sin, avg_cos)
      
      if (mean_angle < 0) {
        mean_angle <- mean_angle + 2 * pi
      }
      
      mean_angle / (2 * pi) * n_days[1]
    }
  ) |> ungroup()

print(gas_circ)

```

### Task 7

* Using the cut function, create two nominal variables from quantitative data in the `daily` dataset. Use these groups to summarize the data. Use arrange to show the smallest or largest values in these comparisons.

```{r}
daily_grouped <- daily |> mutate(temperature_group = cut(temperature, breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")),
    heating_profiles = cut(heating_profiles, breaks = 2, labels = c("Low", "High"))
  )

summary_data <- daily_grouped |> group_by(temperature_group, heating_profiles) |>
  summarize(
    mean_consumption_small = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_industry = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_power = mean(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

summary_data_sorted <- summary_data |> arrange(mean_consumption_small)
print(summary_data_sorted)
```

### Task 8

* There are several variables that pull out data by different industry (the `_idx` columns). Create a table for these columns using `select` and the `ends_with` function. Provide two different plots that show of the relations between these variables (you do not need to have all variables in each plot).

```{r}
 idx_table <- daily |> select(ends_with("_idx"))

print(head(idx_table))

if(ncol(idx_table) >= 2) {
  col1 <- names(idx_table)[1]
  col2 <- names(idx_table)[2]
  
  plot1 <- ggplot(idx_table, aes_string(x = col1, y = col2)) +geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter Plot of", col1, "vs", col2),
         x = col1,
         y = col2) +
    theme_minimal()
  print(plot1)
}

if(ncol(idx_table) >= 3) {
  col3 <- names(idx_table)[3]
  
  plot2 <- ggplot(idx_table, aes_string(x = col1, y = col3)) +geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter Plot of", col1, "vs", col3),
         x = col1,
         y = col3) +
    theme_minimal()
  print(plot2)
}
```

## Objectives

### Objective 1

* A marginal distribution
    ```{r}
    ggplot(daily, aes(x = temperature)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count / sum(count))), binwidth = 3, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
    labs(title = "Marginal Distribution of Temperature",
       x = "Temperature (K)",
       y = "Proportion")
    ```
    This histogram shows the distribution of daily temperatures in the dataset. The distribution looks to be 
    approximately normal with a mean of about 284 Kelvin. This tells us that the temperature for most of the days in the 
    dataset are round 284, with extreme values being less common.
    
    * A joint distribution
    ```{r}
    daily_seasons <- daily |> mutate(season = cut(month,
                                     breaks = c(0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 12),
                                     labels = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter")
                                     ))
    filtered_daily <- daily_seasons |> filter(!is.na(consumption_industry))
    ggplot(filtered_daily, aes(x = solar_radiation, y = consumption_industry, color = season)) +
    geom_density_2d() +
    labs(title = "Joint Distribution of Solar Radiation and Household Energy Consumption by Season",
         x = "Solar Radiation",
         y = "Household Energy Consumption (Small Consumers)",
       color = "Season")
    ```
    The graph shows a negative relationship between consumption and solar radiation across seasons. This means that as 
    solar radiation increases increases, industry consumption decreases and shows us how solar radiation is affected by 
    season.
    
    * A plot of a summary measure such as a conditional mean
    ```{r}
    daily |> group_by(month) |> summarize(mean_manufacturing_idx = mean(manufacturing_idx, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = mean_manufacturing_idx)) + geom_line(color = "blue", group = 1) +
    labs(title = "Mean Manufacturing Index by Month",
         x = "Month",
         y = "Mean Index")
    ```
    This plot about mean manufacturing index vs month plots the mean manufacturing index across all the years for each 
    month. It tells us that the mean manufacturing index is, on average, the highest in March and the lowest in August.
    
    * A plot using `facet_wrap` or `facet_grid`
    ```{r}
    new_daily <- daily |> filter(!is.na(consumption_small))
    new_daily |> ggplot(aes(x = heating_profiles, y = consumption_small)) + geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~ long_weekend, label = labeller(long_weekend = c("0" = "No Long Weekend", "1" = "Long Weekend"))) +
    labs(title = "Small Station Consumption vs Heating Profiles by Long Weekend Status",
         x = "Heating Profile",
         y = "Consumption (Small)")
    ```
    This graph shows us whether or not having a long weekend affects small consumers station consumption vs heating 
    profile. As wecan see in the faceted plot above, it doesn't really affect it.
    
    * A plot that shows seasonal effects before the crisis (September 2021 until October 2022)
    ```{r}
    new_daily <- daily |> filter(!is.na(consumption_power))
    new_daily |> filter(date >= as.Date("2017-01-01") & date <= as.Date("2021-8-31")) |> 
    ggplot(aes(x = date, y = consumption_power)) + geom_line(color = "blue") +
    labs(title = "Seasonal Effects on Power Station Consumption (Jan 2017 - August 2021)",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Consumption (Power)")
    ```
This graph shows us that January has the lowest consumption for power stations and February has the highest across all the years. Overall the graph fluctuates a lot, but tend to have lower values in the summer and higher values in the winter
    

### Objective 2

* Compare and contrast holidays and non-holidays for household energy consumption. Select 3 ways of comparing these groups. Provide at least one graph.
```{r}
mean_consumption <- daily |> group_by(holiday) |>
summarize(mean_consumption_small = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE))
print(mean_consumption)


new_daily <- daily |> filter(!is.na(consumption_small))
ggplot(new_daily, aes(x = factor(holiday), y = consumption_small)) + geom_boxplot() +
labs(title = "Distribution of Household Energy Consumption for Holidays vs. Non-Holidays",
      x = "Holiday (0 = Non-Holiday, 1 = Holiday)",
      y = "Household Energy Consumption (Small Consumers)")


daily_seasons2 <- daily |> mutate(season = cut(month,
                                     breaks = c(0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 12),
                                     labels = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall", "Winter")
                                     ))
filtered_daily <- daily_seasons2 |> filter(!is.na(consumption_industry))

ggplot(filtered_daily, aes(x = wages, y = consumption_industry, color = season)) + geom_density_2d() +
  labs(title = "Joint Distribution of Wages vs. Small Consumers Consumption by Season",
       x = "Wages",
       y = "Small Consumers ",
       color = "Season")

```


### Objective 3

* According to the paper, the gas crisis occurred between September 2021 until October 2022. Compare this period with the periods before and after on household and industrial consumption. Write a paragraph explaining your findings.

```{r}
daily_period <- daily |>
  mutate(period = case_when(
    date < as.Date("2021-09-01") ~ "Before",
    date >= as.Date("2021-09-01") & date <= as.Date("2022-10-31") ~ "During",
    date > as.Date("2022-10-31") ~ "After"
  ))

stats <- daily_period |> group_by(period) |>
  summarize(
    mean_household = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
    std_household = sd(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_industrial = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
    std_industrial = sd(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(stats)

```
Mean household consumption started at 1.07, then dipped to 0.977 during the crisis and then rose up to 1.53 after the 
crisis. The standard deviation of the mean also decreased after the crisis indicating more stability. The crisis led to 
more overall household consumption. The mean industrial consumption started at 1.22 before the crisis and decreases 
during the crisis and then again after the crisis. The crisis significantly impacted industrial consumption and it has yet to recover to pre-crisis levels. The standard deviation after the crisis is the lowest suggesting that it's more 
stable.

### Objective 4

* Explore the [documentation for ggplot](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). Select one geometery and one `stat_` function we have not used before or use an option to a previously used geometry/stat with a new option. Write a short paragraph explaining what the plots show. 

```{r}
library(quantreg)

# Create a "clean" version of daily that excludes NA or infinite values
daily_clean <- daily %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(temperature), 
    !is.na(consumption_small),
    is.finite(temperature),
    is.finite(consumption_small)
  )

#stat_ellipse - scatter plot with 95% confidence ellipse
ggplot(daily_clean, aes(x = temperature, y = consumption_small)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkgreen") +
  stat_ellipse(level = 0.95, color = "blue", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Household Consumption vs. Temperature with 95% Ellipse",
    x = "Temperature (K)",
    y = "Household Consumption (Small Consumers)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

#geom_quantile - scatter plot with quantile regression lines
ggplot(daily_clean, aes(x = temperature, y = consumption_small)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = "darkgreen") +
  geom_quantile(quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Quantile Regression for Household Consumption vs. Temperature",
    x = "Temperature (K)",
    y = "Household Consumption (Small Consumers)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
First Plot (stat_ellipse)
This scatter plot shows household consumption versus temperature, with a 95% confidence ellipse wrapped around the points. The 
ellipse, drawn by stat_ellipse(), basically highlights where most of the data falls, so you can see the general shape and spread of 
the relationship. It’s a quick way to visualize how closely the two variables cluster together and if there’s any obvious tilt or 
pattern in the data.

Second Plot (geom_quantile)
Here, I used geom_quantile() to add three regression lines for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Instead of just showing how the 
average consumption changes with temperature, these lines reveal how consumption behaves across different parts of the distribution. 
It’s super handy for spotting whether certain ranges of temperature or consumption behave differently than the rest.

### Objective 4

* Investigate solar radiation's marginal distribution and also it's relationship with temperature.
```{r}
# Marginal Distribution of Solar Radiation
ggplot(daily, aes(x = solar_radiation)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 30, fill = "steelblue", color = "black") +
  geom_density(color = "red", size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Marginal Distribution of Solar Radiation",
    x = "Solar Radiation",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Relationship between Solar Radiation and Temperature
ggplot(daily, aes(x = temperature, y = solar_radiation)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "blue") +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship between Solar Radiation and Temperature",
    x = "Temperature (K)",
    y = "Solar Radiation"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

# Compute the correlation between solar radiation and temperature
correlation <- cor(daily$solar_radiation, daily$temperature, use = "complete.obs")
cat("Correlation between solar radiation and temperature:", correlation, "\n")

# Optional: Fit a linear model to further inspect the relationship
model <- lm(solar_radiation ~ temperature, data = daily)
print(summary(model))

```
The marginal distribution of solar radiation is right-skewed, with a high density of lower radiation values and a gradual decline in 
frequency as radiation levels increase, showing a bimodal pattern with peaks at lower and mid-range values. Solar radiation exhibits 
a strong positive linear relationship with temperature. 

### Objective 5

* Use `group_by` to summarize by a new feature of this data set not otherwise discussed in the tasks or objectives. What have you learned with these investigation?

```{r}
weekday_summary <- daily |> group_by(weekday) |>
  summarise(
    mean_consumption_industry = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_power = mean(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_household = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

print(weekday_summary)
```
The mean industry consumption is the highest during the weekdays (with a peak of 1.25 on Wednesday) and the lowest on the 
weekends (with a low of 1.08 on Saturday). The mean power station consumption has a similar pattern to mean industry consumption, 
where consumption is the lowest on the weekends and the highest on the weekdays. Consumption being the highest on the weekdays and 
lowest on the weekends make sense for these stations because the weekdays are when there are the most operations. The mean 
consumption for household is relatively consistent across the week.


### Objective 6

* Based on your exploration of the data, suggest three questions that could be asked from these data or additional data that you can imagine. Be sure to explain why the previous plots or calculations indicates that this would be an interesting our useful exploration.

### Objective 7

* Write an abstract for your project. Briefly explain what you did, what you found, and why a potential reader should be interested in your research.
