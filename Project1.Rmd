## Overview

In the `data` directory of this project you will find the file from a paper published in *Nature Energy* titled [Natural gas savings in Germany during the 2022 energy crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-023-01260-5). Here is the abstract of the article:

> Russia curbed its natural gas supply to Europe in 2021 and 2022, creating a grave energy crisis. This Article empirically estimates the crisis response of natural gas consumers in Germanyâ€”for decades, the largest export market for Russian gas. Using a multiple regression model, we estimate the response of small consumers, industry and power stations separately, controlling for the nonlinear temperature-heating relationship, seasonality and trends. We find significant and substantial gas savings for all consumer groups, but with differences in timing and size. For instance, industry started reducing consumption as early as September 2021, while small consumers saved substantially only since March 2022. Across all sectors, gas consumption during the second half of 2022 was 23% below the temperature-adjusted baseline. We discuss the drivers behind these savings and draw conclusions on their role in coping with the crisis.

Your job in this project falls into two categories:

1. A set of **tasks** that your group must complete exactly
2. A set of **objectives** that are more general in their approach.

## Tasks

### Task 1

* Load two files. To work in the console, use the `Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location`.
    * Call the first table `daily`: "./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv"
    * Call the second table `gas`: "./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv". Be sure to properly import the `Date` column.
    * Demonstrate that these have been loaded by showing the number of rows and columns in each table.
```{r}
daily <- read_csv("./data/natural_gas_germany_daily.csv")
gas <- read_csv(
  "./data/dutch_ttf_natural_gas.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    Date = col_date(format = "%m/%d/%Y"),  
    Price = col_double(),
    Open = col_double(),
    High = col_double(),
    Low = col_double(),
    `Vol.` = col_character(),
    `Change %` = col_character())
  )
```

### Task 2

* The data in `daily` are collected over days, with information on different types of natural gas consumption (`consumption_small`, `consumption_industry`, `consumption_power`). Provide summaries of typical values for each of these three types of consumption.

```{r}
summary_small <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
)

summary_industry <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
)

summary_power <- daily |> summarize(
  mean = mean(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  median = median(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  sd = sd(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  min = min(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE),
  max = max(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)
)

print(summary_small)
print(summary_industry)
print(summary_power)

```


### Task 3

Answer some questions about the data in `daily`:

* How many weeks do the data cover?
The data covers 312.86 weeks (Ask about rounding!!)
```{r}
weeks <- daily |> summarize(num_weeks = as.numeric(difftime(max(date), min(date), units = "weeks")))
print(weeks)
```
* What is the percentage change in the `consumption_*` variables (that is the last day minus the first day divided by the first day)?
consumption_small % change: -99.01%
consumption_industry % change: -43.28%
consumption_power % change: -49.44
```{r}
percentage_change <- daily |> filter(!is.na(consumption_small))|> summarize(
    change_small = last(consumption_small) - first(consumption_small) / first(consumption_small) * 100,
    change_industry = (last(consumption_industry) - first(consumption_industry)) / first(consumption_industry) * 100,
    change_power = (last(consumption_power) - first(consumption_power)) / first(consumption_power) * 100
  )
print(percentage_change)
```
* What proportion of the days are marked as holidays?
0.0361
```{r}
proportion <- daily |> summarize(holiday_days = sum(holiday, na.rm = TRUE), total_days = n(), proportion =
                                                    holiday_days / total_days)
print(holidays)
```
* For each month in each year, what was the year-month combination with the lowest median `consumption_power` value?
August 2021 has the lowest median_power with 0.1635
```{r}
lowest_median <- daily |>
  mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date)) |>
  group_by(year, month) |>
  summarize(median_power = median(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  arrange(median_power)
print(lowest_median)
```
   
### Task 4

* The original paper aggregated the data to monthly means for each consumption type in `daily` and the `Price` column of `gas` to produce the following image:<br/>
![Original consumption by month graph](proj1fig1.png)<br/>
Produce plots that show the same information that is presented in this plot. Your plots do not have to have the same colors or markings, but we should be able to use them to compare the trends for the three price variables. 

### Task 5

* Write a predicate function that returns true if any value in vector is missing. Use this function to find columns with missing values in the `daily` column. Create a plot or table that shows how often patterns of missingness occur: are all of the missing values in the same rows or are the various columns missing data in different ways?

```{r}
  # Define a predicate function that returns TRUE if any value in a vector is missing
has_missing <- function(x) {
  any(is.na(x))
}

# Use the function to check for missing values in each column of the 'daily' data frame
missing_columns <- sapply(daily, has_missing)
# Print out only those columns that have missing values
print("Columns with missing values:")
print(missing_columns[missing_columns == TRUE])

# Create a table showing the pattern of missingness by row
# For each row, create a string pattern where "1" indicates a missing value and "0" indicates a non-missing value
daily_missing_pattern <- daily %>%
  mutate(missing_pattern = apply(is.na(.), 1, function(row) paste(ifelse(row, "1", "0"), collapse = ""))) %>%
  count(missing_pattern) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
  
print(daily_missing_pattern)

# Plot the frequency of each missingness pattern
ggplot(daily_missing_pattern, aes(x = missing_pattern, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Missingness Patterns in Daily Data",
       x = "Missingness Pattern (1 = Missing, 0 = Present)",
       y = "Count of Rows") +
  theme_minimal()

```

The missingness pattern plot shows that most rows have no missing values, but there are multiple distinct patterns where different columns are missing data. This indicates that missing values are not concentrated in a single set of rows, but instead, different columns have missing values in varying ways. Some rows have only one or two missing values, while others have a unique combination of missing columns. This suggests that missingness is likely due to incomplete data collection or specific external factors affecting different variables separately rather than a single systematic issue affecting entire rows.



### Task 6

* Limit the `gas` table to days where the price exceeded the yearly median. Use the concept of [circular means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_mean) to compute the average day of the year when price exceeds the yearly median price. The `yday` function will likely be useful here. 

```{r circular-mean, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

gas_circ <- gas %>%
  # Extract the calendar year from Date
  mutate(Year = year(Date)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  # Compute the median Price for each year
  mutate(yearly_median = median(Price, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  # Keep rows where Price exceeds the yearly median
  filter(Price > yearly_median) %>%
  # Convert to day of year; handle leap years
  mutate(
    day_of_year = yday(Date),
    # n_days is the number of days in the given year (365 or 366)
    n_days = if_else(leap_year(Date), 366, 365)
  ) %>%
  # Summarize by computing the circular mean of day_of_year
  summarise(
    circ_mean_day = {
      # Convert day_of_year to an angle in radians
      angles <- 2 * pi * (day_of_year / n_days)
      
      # Compute mean of cos() and sin() to handle wrap-around
      avg_cos <- mean(cos(angles))
      avg_sin <- mean(sin(angles))
      
      # atan2() gives the average angle
      mean_angle <- atan2(avg_sin, avg_cos)
      
      # Ensure angle is in [0, 2*pi)
      if (mean_angle < 0) {
        mean_angle <- mean_angle + 2 * pi
      }
      
      # Convert the angle back to a day of year
      mean_angle / (2 * pi) * n_days[1]
    }
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

gas_circ

```

### Task 7

* Using the cut function, create two nominal variables from quantitative data in the `daily` dataset. Use these groups to summarize the data. Use arrange to show the smallest or largest values in these comparisons.

```{r}
daily_grouped <- daily |> mutate(temperature_group = cut(temperature, breaks = 3, labels = c("Low", "Medium", "High")),
    heating_profiles = cut(heating_profiles, breaks = 2, labels = c("Low", "High"))
  )

summary_data <- daily_grouped |> group_by(temperature_group, heating_profiles) |>
  summarize(
    mean_consumption_small = mean(consumption_small, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_industry = mean(consumption_industry, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_consumption_power = mean(consumption_power, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

summary_data_sorted <- summary_data |> arrange(mean_consumption_small)
print(summary_data_sorted)
```

### Task 8

* There are several variables that pull out data by different industry (the `_idx` columns). Create a table for these columns using `select` and the `ends_with` function. Provide two different plots that show of the relations between these variables (you do not need to have all variables in each plot).

```{r}
  # Create a table with columns that end with '_idx'
idx_table <- daily %>%
  select(ends_with("_idx"))

# Print the first few rows of the table to verify the selection
print(head(idx_table))

# Create a scatter plot between the first two _idx columns (if available)
if(ncol(idx_table) >= 2) {
  col1 <- names(idx_table)[1]
  col2 <- names(idx_table)[2]
  
  plot1 <- ggplot(idx_table, aes_string(x = col1, y = col2)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter Plot of", col1, "vs", col2),
         x = col1,
         y = col2) +
    theme_minimal()
  print(plot1)
}

# Create a second scatter plot between the first and third _idx columns (if available)
if(ncol(idx_table) >= 3) {
  col3 <- names(idx_table)[3]
  
  plot2 <- ggplot(idx_table, aes_string(x = col1, y = col3)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = paste("Scatter Plot of", col1, "vs", col3),
         x = col1,
         y = col3) +
    theme_minimal()
  print(plot2)
}
```
